This is a Portfolio of my work in ITP225. It was a class I had taken in 2025 at New River Community College. In this class we learned, how to make a page and deploy it on github pages, how to use react, and make simple pages like to-do list that features a way to make a to do list that is editable and saves to the brower. 

In this though, is my personal work from this class. I have a page for the first webpage I made, my first page deploy in general, the To-Do app I mentioned earlier, a fetching data demo that grabs info from JSONPlaceholder API, a local fetch demo where it grabs data from an API server that runs locally, and finally my Bookmark page. 

The bookmark page is my page I worked on for my final project in my ITP 225 class. It features being able to make folders for your links with editiable names and can be deleted, and the urls can be added and edited with a note that can tag along with the url that can also be edited and deleted. I just thought it would be an easier way to keep up with them and be able to see what each bookmark is without having to go through a lot to get to it. 

The idea is that students or people who have very busy lives and need their bookmarks quickly and effectively, that they could just go to the page and find it with ease.
